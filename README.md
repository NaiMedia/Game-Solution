# Game-Solution
Sudoku Solver/Generator
1/7/2020
for the foundation of our coding Shaleka provided us with the article shown here https://github.com/NaiMedia/GameSolution.git
tonight began with Carlos's question which was can we create a singular function derived from the multiple functions defined in the stack overflow article.
we streamlined the definnitions there and manipulated those functions.
by streamlining we skipped certain steps in the original code to create a sudoku puzzle.
we moved the code lines around to figure out which order was proper to produce the desired outcome 
we also commented out some lines of that code
we defined puzzle using several blocks of code manipulated from the article.
we eliminated code that was unnecessary to run our puzzle
we commented out certain print statements and for loops in the original code, so that will not include the output of the original code previous steps 
in our puzzle.


What's next?
1st figure out the relationship between the "Ps" and the "Empties"
2nd figure out how to create a maximum and also a minimum the number of digits in the "empties"?
so that our puzzle functions do not erase too many or too few digits from the grid
this will allow our code's functions to generate proper sudoku puzzles.
